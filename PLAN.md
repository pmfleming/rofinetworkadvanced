# nm-wifi-rofi-rust plan

Goal: replace the shell/nmcli Wi-Fi listing/rescan path with a Rust D-Bus based helper, then optionally move the full rofi Wi-Fi menu into Rust.

## 1. Scope and constraints

- Use Rust, not Python.
- Use NetworkManager D-Bus for scan/list/status.
- Keep the current rofi UX initially.
- Keep `nmcli` for connection activation/password handling at first to avoid D-Bus secret-agent complexity.
- Integrate with the existing NixOS config only after the helper is stable.

## 2. Initial project setup

- Create a Rust binary crate named `nm-wifi-rofi`.
- Add dependencies:
  - `zbus` for D-Bus
  - `zvariant` if needed for typed D-Bus values
  - `anyhow` for errors
  - `clap` for subcommands
- Add subcommands:
  - `list`
  - `scan`
  - `active`
  - later: `connect`, `rofi`

## 3. D-Bus discovery

Implement NetworkManager object discovery:

1. Connect to the system bus.
2. Query `/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager`.
3. Read `Devices` or call `GetDevices`.
4. For each device, read device type.
5. Keep devices with type `NM_DEVICE_TYPE_WIFI`.

Output useful debug info first:

```text
wifi-device /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Devices/3 wlan0
```

## 4. Access point listing

For each Wi-Fi device:

1. Call `GetAccessPoints` or read `AccessPoints`.
2. For each AP object, read:
   - `Ssid`
   - `Strength`
   - `Flags`
   - `WpaFlags`
   - `RsnFlags`
   - `Frequency`
   - `HwAddress`
   - `LastSeen`
3. Decode SSID byte arrays safely.
4. Convert security flags into simple labels/icons.
5. Deduplicate by SSID, keeping strongest signal.
6. Sort by signal descending.

Initial output should be stable TSV:

```text
SSID<TAB>active<TAB>security<TAB>signal<TAB>frequency<TAB>bssid
```

## 5. Active network detection

Use D-Bus instead of parsing `nmcli`:

1. Read `ActiveAccessPoint` from each Wi-Fi device.
2. Compare it with AP object paths.
3. Mark the matching SSID as active.

## 6. Scan implementation

Use proper NetworkManager scan completion:

1. Read current `LastScan` from the Wi-Fi device.
2. Call `RequestScan({})`.
3. Listen for `org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged`.
4. Wait until `LastScan` changes.
5. Add a timeout fallback, e.g. 12 seconds.
6. Print the refreshed list.

Important: NetworkManager does not provide percentage progress. We can report scan state, elapsed time, retry state, completion, and the number/list of access points discovered so far.

### 6a. Live scan/progress mode

A key goal is to update the displayed network list while scanning, instead of only replacing it after scan completion.

Add a streaming scan mode:

```bash
nm-wifi-rofi scan --stream --timeout 12 --retries 2
```

Behavior:

1. Emit an immediate snapshot of the currently cached NetworkManager access-point list.
2. Register D-Bus signal watchers before requesting the scan:
   - `org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device.Wireless.AccessPointAdded`
   - `org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.Device.Wireless.AccessPointRemoved`
   - `org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.PropertiesChanged` for `LastScan`
3. Call `RequestScan({})`.
4. Whenever access points are added/removed, rebuild/deduplicate/sort the list and emit a new snapshot immediately.
5. When `LastScan` changes, emit a final snapshot and a completion event.
6. If `RequestScan` is rejected, rate-limited, or times out, keep emitting the cached/latest list and report an informative warning instead of leaving the user with an empty menu.
7. Retry scan requests with bounded backoff while the UI remains usable:
   - 1s
   - 2s
   - 4s
   - 8s max
8. Keep machine-readable stream output separate from legacy TSV output. Use JSON Lines for stream events, e.g.:

```jsonl
{"event":"status","message":"requested scan on wlan0"}
{"event":"snapshot","scanning":true,"networks_found":3,"networks":[...]}
{"event":"warning","message":"scan request failed; retrying in 2s"}
{"event":"complete","timed_out":false,"networks_found":18}
```

Rofi note: plain rofi script mode usually consumes one command output at a time. The backend should still expose live JSONL snapshots first; the rofi integration can then either refresh from cached snapshots, use a helper process, or implement a controlled refresh loop.

### 6b. Snapshot cache and first rofi bridge

Add a small cache layer so the live stream can feed UIs that cannot consume an open-ended stream directly.

Implemented cache files:

```text
$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nm-wifi-rofi/latest.json       # last completed scan/list for menu startup
$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nm-wifi-rofi/scan-session.json # active explicit rescan session only
$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nm-wifi-rofi/status.json
```

Commands:

```bash
nm-wifi-rofi scan --stream --cache
nm-wifi-rofi list --cached --json
nm-wifi-rofi rofi
```

Initial rofi behavior:

1. Render cached networks immediately.
2. Render a rescan row.
3. When rescan is selected, spawn `nm-wifi-rofi scan --stream --cache` in the background.
4. Keep the UI responsive by reading cached snapshots instead of waiting for scan completion.
5. Network selection now calls the initial `nmcli` activation fallback and writes connection status into the cache.
6. Progressive scan refresh is exposed while a background scan is running: rescan creates a fresh `scan-session.json`, keeps `latest.json` only for menu startup/fallback, clears the visible list, polls the active NetworkManager AP table while waiting for scan signals, the disabled rescan row shows the same count as the visible network rows, rows are revealed from the active scan session at a 10ms display cadence, `Alt+R` starts/refreshes scanning, and the wrapper uses a rofi timeout custom callback to refresh from cache while the list repopulates.
7. Later, replace the fallback with staged D-Bus activation.

## 7. Parallel integration strategy

Do not replace the existing chooser initially.

- Keep the current shell chooser on `SUPER+N` / `rofi-wifi-menu`.
- Add the Rust/D-Bus chooser as a parallel command on `SUPER+M`.
- Use this parallel path while developing and testing.
- Only consider replacing `SUPER+N` after the Rust chooser is clearly better.

Target commands:

```text
SUPER+N → rofi-wifi-menu          # current stable chooser
SUPER+M → nm-wifi-rofi rofi       # new Rust/D-Bus chooser
```

## 8. Integrate with current shell menu, optional fallback path

If we want an intermediate hybrid before full rofi mode, keep the shell menu but replace only data sources:

- Replace `wifi_entries()` in `config/scripts/rofi-wifi-menu.sh` with:

```sh
nm-wifi-rofi list
```

- Replace rescan implementation with:

```sh
nm-wifi-rofi scan
```

Keep existing shell code for:

- saved profiles
- password prompt
- connection attempts
- captive portal handling

This is optional; the preferred path is a parallel full chooser on `SUPER+M`.

## 9. Package with Nix

Add a package under `/etc/nixos/packages/nm-wifi-rofi` or similar.

Options:

- `rustPlatform.buildRustPackage`
- vendor dependencies with `cargoHash`

Then add the package to `rofiWifiMenu.runtimeInputs`.

## 10. Full rofi-mode rewrite

Once the D-Bus helper is stable, move the entire rofi Wi-Fi script into Rust.

Rust would emit rofi script-mode rows directly and read:

- `ROFI_RETV`
- `ROFI_INFO`
- `ROFI_DATA`

Actions:

- default: emit menu
- `rescan`: request scan, wait for `LastScan`, emit menu
- `portal`: launch captive portal browser
- `connect:<ssid>`: initially shell out to `nmcli`

## 11. Optional full D-Bus connection activation

Only do this later.

Needed pieces:

- list saved `Settings.Connection` profiles over D-Bus
- match profiles by SSID
- call `ActivateConnection`
- create new Wi-Fi connection for unknown SSIDs
- handle secrets/passwords correctly

This is more complex than listing/scanning and should not block the first version.

## 12. Test checklist

- `nm-wifi-rofi list` works with Wi-Fi enabled.
- `nm-wifi-rofi list` handles Wi-Fi disabled gracefully.
- `nm-wifi-rofi scan` waits for `LastScan` change.
- Hidden/invalid UTF-8 SSIDs do not crash the program.
- Duplicate SSIDs collapse to the strongest AP.
- Active SSID is marked correctly.
- Existing rofi connect flow still works.
- Nix build succeeds.

## 13. Success criteria

- No `nmcli device wifi list` parsing remains in the rofi menu.
- Rescan completion is based on `LastScan`, not arbitrary sleep.
- Existing user-visible Wi-Fi behavior remains unchanged or improves.
- Code is small, typed, and testable.
